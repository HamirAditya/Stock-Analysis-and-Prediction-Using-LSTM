Time Forecasting Machine Learning Project with LSTM
This project utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to forecast stock prices for a selected stock over the next 60 days. It is implemented using Python along with various libraries including Streamlit, Pandas, Yahoo Finance API, and Matplotlib.

Overview
Stock price prediction is a challenging yet crucial task in the financial domain. This project aims to forecast stock prices using historical data and LSTM models, which are well-suited for time series forecasting tasks due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies.
